# Hexagon Strategy Game Development Plan

## Project Overview
Converting the existing GameKit turn-based sample into a simple hexagon-based strategy game with soldiers, towers, and houses.

## Game Design Specifications

### Map System
- **Hexagon Grid**: 7x7 or 9x9 hexagonal map
- **Coordinate System**: Axial coordinates for hexagon positioning
- **Terrain**: Simple flat terrain (expandable later)

### Game Units

#### Soldiers (4 Levels)
1. **Scout** - Level 1
   - Cost: 10 gold
   - Health: 20
   - Attack: 5
   - Movement: 3 hexes
   
2. **Warrior** - Level 2
   - Cost: 25 gold
   - Health: 40
   - Attack: 10
   - Movement: 2 hexes
   
3. **Knight** - Level 3
   - Cost: 50 gold
   - Health: 70
   - Attack: 18
   - Movement: 2 hexes
   
4. **Champion** - Level 4
   - Cost: 100 gold
   - Health: 120
   - Attack: 30
   - Movement: 2 hexes

#### Towers (2 Levels)
1. **Watchtower** - Level 1
   - Cost: 40 gold
   - Health: 60
   - Attack: 8
   - Range: 2 hexes (defends surrounding hexes)
   
2. **Fortress** - Level 2
   - Cost: 80 gold
   - Health: 120
   - Attack: 15
   - Range: 3 hexes

#### Economy
1. **House**
   - Base Cost: 30 gold
   - Progressive Cost: Each additional house costs +20 gold (30, 50, 70, 90...)
   - Income: +10 gold per turn per house

### Game Mechanics

#### Turn Structure
1. **Income Phase**: Collect gold from houses
2. **Build Phase**: Purchase units/buildings
3. **Move Phase**: Move units
4. **Combat Phase**: Attack enemy units
5. **End Turn**: Pass to opponent

#### Combat System
- Simple health/damage system
- Towers automatically defend adjacent hexes
- Units can move and attack in same turn

#### Win Conditions
- Eliminate all enemy units
- Control majority of map for 3 consecutive turns
- Economic victory (control 5+ houses)
